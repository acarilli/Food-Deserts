To test the hypothesis that living in a food desert leads to adverse health outcomes we specify the following instrumental variable panel model where $HealthOutcome$ is the percent of adults with diabetes; $HealthyFoodAccess$ is the percent of the population without access to healthy food options, and $AdultObesity$ is the percent of adults with reported BMI in excess of 30. 

\begin{equation}
\tag{1}
\mathit{Health Outcome_{i,t}} = \beta_0 
+ \beta_1\mathit{Healthy Food Access}_{i,t} 
+ \beta_2\mathbf{AdultObesity}_{i,t} 
+ \epsilon_{i,t}
\end{equation}

Were adult obesity is instrumented by

\begin{equation}
\mathit{AdultObesity_{i,t}} = \gamma_0 
+ \gamma_1\mathit{Healthy Food Access}_{i,t} 
+ \gamma_3\mathit{PhysicalInactivity_{i,t}} 
+ \gamma_4\mathit{PopOver65_{i,t}} \notag  \\
+ \gamma_5\mathit{MedianHouseholdIncome_{i,t}} 
+ \gamma_6\mathit{AccessRecreationalFacilities_{i,t}} \notag\\
+ \gamma_7\mathit{AdultSmokers_{i,t}}
+ \gamma_8\mathit{ExcessiveDrinking_{i,t}}
+ \nu_{i,t}
\tag{2}
\end{equation}

The data for our empirical analysis comes from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (@).  We have data for all counties in Virginia from 2011 to 2018.  

We estimate equation (1) as:

```{r eq-1}
food_desert %>%
  filter(year > 2011) %>%
  plm(
    diabetes ~ access_to_healthy_foods + adult_obesity |
    physical_inactivity + access_to_healthy_foods +
    pop_over_65 + median_household_income +
    access_to_recreational_facilities + adult_smoking + excessive_drinking,
    index = "county",
    model = "within",
    effect = "twoways",
    .
  ) %>%
  summary()
```

We cannot reject $H_0: \beta_1=0$ suggesting that lack of access to healthy food options affects.  So the lack of access ot healthy food options does not appear to effect the percentage of the population with diabetes.


To assess the instruments for $\mathit{AdultObesity}$, measured as the percentage of adults the report a BMI greater than 30, we estimated equation (2). With the variables measured as follows: $\mathit{HealthyFoodAccess}$ as the percent of the population without access to healthy food options, $\mathit{PhysicalActivity}$ as percentage of adults aged 20 and over reporting no leisure‐time physical activity, $\mathit{PopOver65}$ as the percentage of the population over 65 years of age, $\mathit{MedianHouseholdIncome}$ as median household income in thousands of dollars, $\mathit{AccessRecreationalFacilities}$ as 
percentage of population with adequate access to locations for physical activity, $\mathit{AdultSmokers}$ as percent of adults who are current smokers, and $\mathit{ExcessiveDrinking}$ as percent of adults reporting binge or heavy drinking.  


```{r iv-reg}
food_desert %>%
  filter(year > 2011) %>%
  plm(
    adult_obesity ~ physical_inactivity +
      pop_over_65 + median_household_income + access_to_healthy_foods +
      access_to_recreational_facilities + adult_smoking + excessive_drinking,
    index = "county",
    model = "within",
    effect = "twoways",
    .
  ) %>%
  summary()
 
```

While we can reject $H_0: \gamma_1=\dotsm=\gamma_8$, the *F-statistic* is less than 10 suggesting weak instruments.  According we will estimate equation (1) a panel model with controls and IV panel model.  

So, we estimate equation (3)

\begin{equation}
\mathit{Health Outcome_{i,t}} = \delta_0 
+ \delta_1\mathit{Healthy Food Access}_{i,t} 
+ \delta_2\mathit{AdultObesity}_{i,t}
+ \delta_3\mathit{PhysicalInactivity_{i,t}}  \notag \\
+ \delta_4\mathit{PopOver65_{i,t}} 
+ \delta_5\mathit{MedianHouseholdIncome_{i,t}} 
+ \delta_6\mathit{AccessRecreationalFacilities_{i,t}}\notag \\
+ \delta_7\mathit{AdultSmokers_{i,t}}
+ \delta_8\mathit{ExcessiveDrinking_{i,t}}
+ \omega_{i,t}
\tag{3}
\end{equation}

```{r eq-3}
food_desert %>%
  filter(year > 2011) %>%
  plm(
    diabetes ~ access_to_healthy_foods + adult_obesity + physical_inactivity +
      pop_over_65 + median_household_income +
      access_to_recreational_facilities + adult_smoking + excessive_drinking + adult_obesity +
      factor(county),
    index = "county",
    model = "within",
    effect = "twoways",
    .
  ) %>%
  summary()
```

We cannot reject $H_0:\delta=0$. Lack of access to healthy food options does not seem to affect the health outcome of adult diabetes.
