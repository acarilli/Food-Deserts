## Diabetes


```{r, diabetes}
food_desert %>% 
  filter(year > 2011) %>% 
  plm(diabetes ~ physical_inactivity + 
        pop_over_65 + median_household_income + access_to_healthy_foods +
        access_to_recreational_facilities + adult_smoking + excessive_drinking + adult_obesity + 
        factor(county), index = "county", model = "within", effect = "twoways", .) %>% 
  summary()
```

## Obesity

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r obesity}
food_desert %>%
  filter(year > 2011) %>%
  plm(
    adult_obesity ~ access_to_healthy_foods + physical_inactivity +
      pop_over_65 + median_household_income +
      access_to_recreational_facilities + adult_smoking + excessive_drinking +
      factor(year),
    index = "county",
    model = "within",
    effect = "twoways",
    .
  ) %>%
  
  summary()
```

## IV

```{r iv}
food_desert %>%
  filter(year > 2011) %>%
  plm(
    diabetes ~ access_to_healthy_foods + adult_obesity |
    physical_inactivity + access_to_healthy_foods +
    pop_over_65 + median_household_income +
    access_to_recreational_facilities + adult_smoking + excessive_drinking,
    index = "county",
    model = "within",
    effect = "twoways",
    .
  ) %>%
  summary()
```


```{r}
food_desert %>%
  filter(year > 2011) %>%
  lm(
    adult_obesity ~ physical_inactivity +
      pop_over_65 + median_household_income + access_to_healthy_foods +
      access_to_recreational_facilities + adult_smoking + excessive_drinking,
    .
  ) %>%
  summary()
```


```{r}
food_desert %>%
  filter(year > 2011) %>%
